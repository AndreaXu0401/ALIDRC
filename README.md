It is slightly simplified implementation of our Using Active Learning to Expand Training Data for Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition paper in Tensorflow.


Requirements
-----
	Python 3.5
	Tensorflow 1.4
	Numpy
	sklearn
  
Preprocess:
----
	training a basic model: python train.py 
  	active learning step: python active_learning_2.py
